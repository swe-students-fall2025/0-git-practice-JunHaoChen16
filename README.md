Understanding is a huge part of software engineer, either understanding code, or requirement. The clean and maintainable code is very important to the project. always considered for others about how your code will be read and updated after long time you wrote it. understanding requirement well is crucial, avoid miscommunication, they can lead to wasted time and useless features.

Thanks for sharing this, Junhao. I found the points about maintaining a work log and stepping outside of your comfort zone especially valuable. Those are habits I’ve seen make a huge difference in career growth. I also liked the advice on exploring other teams and testing the hiring market regularly, as it’s a great reminder not to get too comfortable and to keep developing perspective.
